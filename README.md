## Payloads

### LsassAttack
**Description:**  
`LsassAttack` is a payload for credential capturing on Windows targets.  
It supports two primary methods:
- **Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1**: Extracts credentials directly from memory.  
- **procdump64.exe**: Dumps the `lsass.exe` process for offline analysis.  

**Notes:**  
- Windows Defender and LSASS process protection may interfere with this payload.  
- Administrator privileges are typically required.  

---

### PowerBeaconMenu
**Description:**  
`PowerBeaconMenu` provides a menu-driven interface for managing PowerBeacon payloads directly from the BashBunny.  

It includes placeholders for:
- Validate
- Install
- Uninstall

Replace these with your own PowerBeacon payloads, then copy everything into the BashBunnyâ€™s `payloads` directory for the desired switch position.

---

### PowerBeaconSingle
**Description:**  
`PowerBeaconSingle` is a lightweight payload to perform a single PowerBeacon install or uninstall action, without using the menu-driven interface.

---

## Usage
1. Copy the desired payload directory to the BashBunny `payloads` folder.  
2. Safely eject the BashBunny and switch to the corresponding position.  
3. Deploy against your target system.
